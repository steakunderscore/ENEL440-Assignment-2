This paper details the particle filter. A particle filter is a class of
sophisticated sequential estimation techniques for estimating the state of a
dynamical system. To introduce a Particle filter, first the Bayes filter is
introduced which encompasses both the Particle filter and the Kalman filter.
The implementation of a particle filter is examined and compared to a Kalman
filter where results are compared and concluded. Testing was preformed on a 
video of a spherical ball dropping and bouncing.
